Reference : `Reference for containers: <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/container/>_

1. List the running images in the docker i.e. `Continers <https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/ps/>`_

The running instance of the image is called in stored in somewhere. That somewhere is termed as a container.

    
    # Running images are stored in the container; empty if not running

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker ps

        CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND     CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
        57cdd284a653   alpine:latest   "/bin/sh"   10 minutes ago   Up 10 minutes             adoring_goldwasser

    # If you want to format the output in the horizonal, run the command 1.format.sh

    .. code-block:: bash

        docker ps --format $FORMAT
        # Here the variable FORMAT is exported to the environment variable

        ID      57cdd284a653
        IMAGE   alpine:latest
        COMMAND "/bin/sh"
        CREATED 15 minutes ago
        STATUS  Up 15 minutes
        PORTS
        NAMES   adoring_goldwasser


By default the stopped containers are not shown in the docker. But you can still see them if you need to.

2. List the containers in the docker even if they are stopped

 -l for the latest image

 -a for all the images

.. code-block:: bash

    docker ps -l

    CONTAINER ID   IMAGE           COMMAND     CREATED          STATUS          PORTS     NAMES
    57cdd284a653   alpine:latest   "/bin/sh"   28 minutes ago   Up 28 minutes             adoring_goldwasser

    docker ps -a

    57cdd284a653   alpine:latest   "/bin/sh"   28 minutes ago   Up 28 minutes                           adoring_goldwasser
