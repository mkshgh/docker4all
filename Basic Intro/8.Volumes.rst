Volumes
========

1. Share your directory to the docker

.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -d -it -v path/to/folder:/folderref alpine

2. Share your files to the docker 

Make sure that your file exists before the docker is on. Or else it will assume that it is a directory.

.. code-block:: bash
    
    docker run -d -it -v path/to/file.txt:/file.txt alpine

3. Temporary directory that exists only when the container is running.
    
    Use: -v your-temp-foler name

.. code-block:: bash
    
    docker run -it -v /shared-temp-folder adoring_obsidian

    # If you ls you can see the shared folder

    / # ls
    bin                 mnt                 shared-temp-folder
    dev                 opt                 srv
    etc                 proc                sys
    home                root                tmp
    lib                 run                 usr
    media               sbin                var



4. Check the NAMES of the container which is sharing the data 


.. code-block:: bash

    docker ps -l --format $FORMATID 

    ID ba9ed5d70cef
    IMAGE   adoring_obsidian
    COMMAND "/bin/sh"
    CREATED 3 minutes ago
    STATUS  Up 3 minutes
    PORTS
    NAMES   musing_bardeen

5. Attach the given folder to a new container i.e. shared folder

    It is not shared to the host device and only shared among the given conatiners

    Use: --volumes-from <name of the container sharing the volume>


.. code-block:: bash

    docker run -ti --volumes-from musing_bardeen alpine

If you list the disk you can see the shared containers.

.. code-block:: bash

    / # ls

    bin                 mnt                 shared-temp-folder
    dev                 opt                 srv
    etc                 proc                sys
    home                root                tmp
    lib                 run                 usr
    media               sbin                var

Any container can create the new files and direcotries in this shared folder.

.. code-block:: bash
    / # echo  "This New File is shared to all the conaiters" > shared-temp-folder/more-data.txt


It will be avilable from another conatiner musing_bardeen

.. code-block:: bash
    / # ls shared-temp-folder/
    more-data.txt

The shared folder will be remvoed when all the conatiners which are accessing the volumes are closed.
