Docker Save and Load
=====================

Once you build the images you want to export them to a location and load them to a new place.
Reasons for this might be:

- Exporting your docker environment to new place with the images.
- What if the dependent official image of the docker gets discontinued.
- No access to internet in the current system.

For this docker comes with docker save to export your docker containers and docker load to load your docker images into the system.

Save the Docker images:
------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # you can export a single image
    $ Docker save -o <my_image>.tar.gz alpine

    # you can export multiple images
    $ Docker save -o <my_images>.tar.gz alpine:latest ubuntu sebp/elk

Load the Docker images back to the host:
-----------------------------------------

.. code-block:: bash

    # Load the images again
    docker load -i alpine-image.tar.gz

    # Check the loaded image
    $ docker images
    REPOSITORY      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
    alpine          latest    c059bfaa849c   7 weeks ago    5.59MB
